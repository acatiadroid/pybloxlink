## Guidelines to contribute
To ensure a level of consistency, please do the following when making contributions where applicable:

    * Use the commit description to provide more information on the commit.
* Don't use unnecessarily hateful speech in commits, PRs or issues.
* Ensure commit names are relevant to the commit itself.
* Don't be a dick in general.

## Types of contributions we welcome
* Bug fixes
    * Please heavily test bug fixes to ensure they don't create other bugs/impare functionally of anything.

* Syntax improvements
* Feature requests/implimentations
    * Please DO NOT make PRs for implementing feature requests. Use issues instead as new features won't be implimented by anyone besides [acatia](https://github.com/acatiadroid).
